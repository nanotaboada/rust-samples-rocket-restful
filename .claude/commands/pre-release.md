Run the pre-release checklist for this project. Work through all three phases
in order, pausing for explicit confirmation at each decision point before
proceeding. Never create a branch, commit, tag, or push without approval.

---

## Phase 1 — Determine next release

1. Run `git status` and confirm the working tree is clean and on `master`.
   If not, stop and report the problem.

2. Run `git tag --sort=-v:refname` to list existing tags. Identify the most
   recent tag matching `v*.*.*-*` and extract its player codename.

3. Read the A–Z player table from `CHANGELOG.md` to find the next player:
   - **No tags yet**: start at `A` (first player in the table).
   - **Normal case**: use the player that follows the last used codename
     alphabetically. If letters were skipped, pick the next after the
     highest existing codename — do not backfill gaps.
   - **Last codename is `Z`** (Zlatan): the list is finite. Stop and flag
     that the naming convention needs to be revisited before proceeding.

4. Read the `[Unreleased]` section of `CHANGELOG.md` and infer the version
   bump using these rules (applied in order — first match wins):
   - If the `[Unreleased]` section has **no entries at all**, stop and report
     that there is nothing to release — ask the user to add changelog entries
     before proceeding.
   - Any entry contains the word **BREAKING** (case-insensitive), a
     `BREAKING CHANGE:` token in a commit footer, or a `!` suffix after
     the commit type/scope (e.g. `feat!:` or `feat(scope)!:`) → **major** bump
   - Any `### Added` subsection has entries → **minor** bump
   - Otherwise (only `### Changed`, `### Fixed`, `### Removed`) → **patch** bump

5. Compute the next version:
   - **No tags yet** (step 2 found no matching tag): use `v0.1.0` as the base
     version and apply the bump from step 4 (e.g. base `v0.1.0` + minor →
     `v0.1.0`; base `v0.1.0` + major → `v1.0.0`). Always include the leading
     `v` in the proposed tag.
   - **Normal case**: apply the bump to the semver of the latest tag (e.g.
     `v2.0.0-benzema` + minor → `v2.1.0-{next-player}`).

6. Present a summary for confirmation before continuing:
   - Last tag and player
   - Next version and player codename
   - Bump type and the reasoning (what triggered it)
   - Proposed tag: `vX.Y.Z-{player}`
   - Proposed branch: `release/vX.Y.Z-{player}`

   **Wait for explicit approval before proceeding to Phase 2.**

## Phase 2 — Prepare release branch

1. Create branch `release/vX.Y.Z-{player}` from `master`.

2. Edit `CHANGELOG.md`:
   - Replace `## [Unreleased]` with `## [X.Y.Z - PlayerName] - YYYY-MM-DD`
     (use today's date; use the player's display name from the table, e.g.
     "Benzema", "Cannavaro").
   - Consolidate duplicate subsection headings (e.g. two `### Added` blocks
     should be merged into one).
   - Add a new empty `## [Unreleased]` section at the top (above the new
     versioned heading) with the standard subsections.
   - Update the compare links at the bottom of the file:
     - `[unreleased]` → `.../compare/vX.Y.Z-{player}...HEAD`
     - Add `[X.Y.Z - PlayerName]` → `.../compare/v{prev-tag}...vX.Y.Z-{player}`

3. Show the full diff of `CHANGELOG.md` and propose this commit message:

   ```bash
   docs(changelog): prepare release notes for vX.Y.Z-{player} (#issue)
   ```

   **Wait for explicit approval before committing.**

4. Run `/pre-commit`, manually skipping step 1 — do not re-run or re-attempt
   the CHANGELOG update; it was already completed above. Open with: "Skip
   step 1 — CHANGELOG was already updated as part of this release branch."
   Proceed directly with steps 2–7.

5. Propose opening a PR from `release/vX.Y.Z-{player}` into `master`.
   **Wait for explicit approval before opening.**

6. Open the PR with:
   - Title: `docs(changelog): prepare release notes for vX.Y.Z-{player}`
   - Body summarising what is included in this release.

---

## Phase 3 — Tag and release

1. Wait — do not proceed until the user confirms:
   - CI is green
   - The PR has been merged into `master`

2. Once confirmed, run:
   ```bash
   git checkout master && git pull origin master
   ```
   and show the resulting `git log --oneline -3`.

3. Propose the annotated tag:
   ```bash
   git tag -a vX.Y.Z-{player} -m "Release X.Y.Z - PlayerName"
   ```

   **Wait for explicit approval before creating the tag.**

4. Create the tag, then propose:
   ```bash
   git push origin vX.Y.Z-{player}
   ```

   **Wait for explicit approval before pushing.** Remind the user that pushing
   the tag triggers the CD workflow which will build, publish the Docker image,
   and create the GitHub Release.
