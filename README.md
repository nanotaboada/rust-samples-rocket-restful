### Module Responsibilities

| Module | Responsibility |
| ------ | -------------- |
| **models** | Data structures for the player domain (Player, PlayerRequest, PlayerResponse) and conversions between them |
| **state** | Thread-safe application state management using Mutex for concurrent access |
| **services** | Pure business logic functions for CRUD operations, validation, and ID generation |
| **routes** | HTTP endpoint handlers that delegate to services and handle HTTP concerns (status codes, JSON) |
| **main.rs** | Application initialization, route mounting, and data loading |

## Architecture

**Modular Layered Architecture:**

```text
HTTP Request → Routes → Services → State (Mutex) → In-Memory Storage → Response
```

**Dependency Flow:**

- Routes → Services → State (unidirectional)
- Services contain pure business logic, framework-agnostic
- Routes handle HTTP concerns (status codes, JSON serialization)
- State management is isolated from business logic

**Data Flow:**

- HTTP requests are received by Rocket route handlers in `routes/`
- Route handlers acquire locks and delegate to pure functions in `services/`
- Services perform business logic (validation, CRUD) on borrowed data
- Services return Results that routes convert to HTTP responses
- Thread-safe state access via `Mutex<Vec<Player>>`

**Type Safety:**

- **Player** - Internal storage entity (in `models/player.rs`)
- **PlayerRequest** - API input for `POST`/`PUT` (no ID, system-generated)
- **PlayerResponse** - API output (includes ID)

This separation provides type safety, testability, and prevents accidental exposure of internal implementation details.

## API Reference

### Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
| ------ | ---- | ----------- |
| `GET` | `/health` | Health check |
| `GET` | `/players` | List all players |
| `GET` | `/players/:id` | Get player by ID |
| `GET` | `/players/squadnumber/:squadnumber` | Get player by squad number |
| `POST` | `/players` | Create new player |
| `PUT` | `/players/:id` | Update player |
| `DELETE` | `/players/:id` | Remove player |

### Response Codes

| Code | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `200 OK` | Successful GET/PUT |
| `201 Created` | Successful POST |
| `204 No Content` | Successful DELETE |
| `404 Not Found` | Player not found |
| `409 Conflict` | Duplicate squad number |

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Rust 2024 Edition or higher** (managed via `rust-toolchain.toml`)
- **Cargo** (comes with Rust)

## Quick Start

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nanotaboada/rust-samples-rocket-restful.git
cd rust-samples-rocket-restful
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
cargo build
```

### Start the development server

```bash
cargo run
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:9000`.

### Access the application

- **API:** `http://localhost:9000`
- **Health Check:** `http://localhost:9000/health`

### Test the API

```bash
# Get all players
curl http://localhost:9000/players

# Get player by ID
curl http://localhost:9000/players/1

# Get player by squad number
curl http://localhost:9000/players/squadnumber/10

# Create a new player
curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/players \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "firstName": "Test First Name",
    "middleName": "",
    "lastName": "Test Last Name",
    "dateOfBirth": "2000-01-01",
    "squadNumber": 99,
    "position": "Test Position",
    "abbrPosition": "AP",
    "team": "Test Team",
    "league": "Test League",
    "starting11": false
  }'

# Update a player (requires full object)
curl -X PUT http://localhost:9000/players/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "firstName": "Emiliano",
    "middleName": "",
    "lastName": "Martínez",
    "dateOfBirth": "1992-09-02",
    "squadNumber": 23,
    "position": "Goalkeeper",
    "abbrPosition": "GK",
    "team": "Aston Villa",
    "league": "Premier League",
    "starting11": true
  }'

# Delete a player
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:9000/players/21
```

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run tests with output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Run tests with detailed output
cargo test -- --show-output
```

## CI/CD

The project uses GitHub Actions with sequential job execution:

### Pipeline

Format → Lint → Build → Test

Each job depends on the previous one succeeding. This provides fail-fast feedback and saves CI resources.

## Command Summary

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `cargo run` | Start development server |
| `cargo build` | Build the application |
| `cargo build --release` | Build optimized release version |
| `cargo test` | Run all tests |
| `cargo fmt` | Format code |
| `cargo clippy` | Run linter |
| `cargo clean` | Clean build artifacts |
