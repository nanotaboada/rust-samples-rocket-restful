Proof of Concept for a RESTful Web Service built with **Rocket** and **Rust 2024 Edition**. This project demonstrates best practices for building a layered, testable, and maintainable API implementing CRUD operations for a Players resource (Argentina 2022 FIFA World Cup squad).

## Features

- 🏗️ **Layered Architecture** - Modular design with routes, services, repositories, state, and models as distinct packages
- 🔒 **Thread-Safe State** - SQLite access via r2d2 connection pool using Rocket's `State<T>`
- ✅ **Type Safety** - Strong Rust type system with Serde for request/response serialization
- 🚦 **Comprehensive Testing** - Integration tests covering all endpoints with real SQLite
- 🐳 **Containerized Deployment** - Multi-stage Docker builds with migration-based database initialization
- 🔄 **Automated Pipeline** - Continuous integration with cargo test, clippy, and GitHub releases

## Tech Stack

| Category | Technology |
| -------- | ---------- |
| **Language** | [Rust 2024 Edition](https://www.rust-lang.org/) |
| **Web Framework** | [Rocket 0.5.1](https://rocket.rs/) |
| **Serialization** | [Serde](https://serde.rs/) |
| **Unique IDs** | [uuid](https://github.com/uuid-rs/uuid) |
| **ORM / Migrations** | [Diesel](https://diesel.rs/) (SQLite + r2d2 features) + [diesel_migrations](https://docs.rs/diesel_migrations) |
| **Containerization** | [Docker](https://github.com/docker) & [Docker Compose](https://github.com/docker/compose) |

## Architecture

Layered architecture with Rocket's managed state for thread-safe dependency sharing.

## API Reference

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Status |
| ------ | -------- | ----------- | ------ |
| `GET` | `/players` | List all players | `200 OK` |
| `GET` | `/players/:id` | Get player by ID | `200 OK` |
| `GET` | `/players/squadnumber/:squadnumber` | Get player by squad number | `200 OK` |
| `POST` | `/players` | Create new player | `201 Created` |
| `PUT` | `/players/squadnumber/:squadnumber` | Update player by squad number | `200 OK` |
| `DELETE` | `/players/squadnumber/:squadnumber` | Remove player by squad number | `204 No Content` |
| `GET` | `/health` | Health check | `200 OK` |

Error codes: `404 Not Found` (player not found) · `409 Conflict` (duplicate squad number on `POST`)

Alternatively, use [`rest/players.rest`](rest/players.rest) with the [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) extension for VS Code, or the built-in HTTP Client in JetBrains IDEs.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Rust 2024 Edition or higher** (managed via `rust-toolchain.toml`)
- **Cargo** (comes with Rust)
- **Docker & Docker Compose** (optional, for containerized deployment)

## Quick Start

### Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nanotaboada/rust-samples-rocket-restful.git
cd rust-samples-rocket-restful
```

### Build

```bash
cargo build
```

### Run

```bash
cargo run
```

### Access

Once the application is running, you can access:

- **API Server**: `http://localhost:9000`
- **Health Check**: `http://localhost:9000/health`

## Containers

### Build and Start

```bash
docker compose up
```

> 💡 **Note:** On first run, the app automatically runs pending Diesel migrations — creating the schema and seeding the full 26-player squad — and stores the database in a persistent volume. On subsequent runs, migrations are skipped and existing data is preserved.

### Stop

```bash
docker compose down
```

### Reset Database

To remove the volume and let migrations reinitialize the database from scratch on next start:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

### Pull Docker Images

Each release publishes multiple tags for flexibility:

```bash
# By semantic version (recommended for production)
docker pull ghcr.io/nanotaboada/rust-samples-rocket-restful:1.0.0

# By nominee name (memorable alternative)
docker pull ghcr.io/nanotaboada/rust-samples-rocket-restful:benzema

# Latest release
docker pull ghcr.io/nanotaboada/rust-samples-rocket-restful:latest
```

## Environment Variables

```bash
# Database storage path (default: ./storage/players-sqlite3.db)
STORAGE_PATH=./storage/players-sqlite3.db

# Rocket profile: debug or release (default: debug)
ROCKET_PROFILE=release
```
