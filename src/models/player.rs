//! Player domain models and type mappings.
//!
//! This module defines the representations of a player used across the
//! application layers.
//!
//! ## Representations
//!
//! | Type              | Purpose                                         | Layer      |
//! |-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------|
//! | [`Player`]        | Diesel Queryable — read from `players` table    | repository |
//! | [`NewPlayer`]     | Diesel Insertable — write to `players` table    | repository |
//! | [`PlayerRequest`] | Inbound API payload (ID excluded)               | routes     |
//! | [`PlayerResponse`]| Outbound API payload (ID included)              | routes     |
//!
//! ## Rust note: derive macros
//!
//! `#[derive(...)]` auto-generates standard trait implementations:
//! - `Debug` — enables `{:?}` formatting for logging and tests
//! - `Clone` — allows creating an independent copy of a value
//! - `Serialize` — converts the struct to JSON (for API responses)
//! - `Deserialize` — populates the struct from JSON (for API requests)
//! - `#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]` maps snake_case Rust fields to
//!   camelCase JSON keys (e.g. `first_name` → `"firstName"`)
